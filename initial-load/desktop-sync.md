title: Alfresco Desktop Sync
---

With Desktop Sync, desktop users can securely and automatically sync content between their desktop and Alfresco Content Services.

This release of Desktop Sync is a compatibility release to support Alfresco Sync Service 4.0, and includes minor UI changes.

You can easily connect to Alfresco Content Services and select folders and sites to view and work with on the desktop, even when working offline.

Once the folders and sites are selected, they are automatically downloaded and visible using Microsoft File Explorer (for Windows) or Finder (for Mac).

Changes are automatically synced from Alfresco Content Services to the desktop, so the latest content is always available. This allows you to work in places where you don't have internet access, secure in the knowledge that your changes will show up in Alfresco Content Services once you're back online.

> **Note:** Desktop Sync replicates content on local desktops for users with the appropriate access. If replication outside the repository isn't allowed by your content policy, you shouldn't deploy Desktop Sync. This version of Desktop Sync doesn't support Smart Folders.

For information about installing and configuring the Desktop Sync service server-side AMP, see [Installing Sync Service]({% link sync-service/latest/install/index.md %}).

title: Administer Desktop Sync
---

If youâ€™re an IT administrator, you can configure a number of features to centrally manage your Desktop Sync clients.

## Manage automatic configuration updates

If you're an IT administrator, you can upload a new configuration file to the repository so that it's automatically 
provided to all Desktop Sync clients.

This allows you to update the configuration file for all your Desktop Sync users without any manual intervention.

1. Create a **Desktop Sync** folder in the Alfresco Content Services repository path: `/Data Dictionary/`

2. Browse to [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"} and download the configuration file: `AlfrescoSync.conf`.

3. Save the file in the new **Desktop Sync** folder.

    >**Note:** Don't rename the file, otherwise the configuration update won't work.

    Once the configuration file is uploaded, users receive a notification telling them that the new configuration 
    file has been downloaded.

    When the Desktop Sync client connects to the repository for file updates, it checks for new versions of the configuration. 
    The client periodically checks for new configuration files - no more than once per 24 hour period. 
    When a new configuration file is found, it's downloaded and retained in the appropriate folder. For example:

    * Windows: `<userHome>\AppData\Local\Alfresco`
    * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Alfresco`

    The existing configuration file is kept as a backup (i.e. `AlfrescoSync-backup.conf`).

    Users will have to restart Desktop Sync to apply the changes.

    >**Note:** If you're a Windows user, you'll see a message stating:
    >
    >```text
    >C:\Users\Program Files\AppData\Local\Alfresco\AlfrescoSync.conf
    >This file has been modified by another program. Do you want to reload it?
    >```

4. Select **OK** to apply the changes to your configuration.

## Manage automatic installation updates

If you're an IT administrator, you can upload new installation files into the repository to automatically update 
all users with Desktop Sync clients.

This ensures users with Desktop Sync clients are always up to date with minimal manual intervention.

1. Create a **Desktop Sync** folder in the Alfresco Content Services repository path: `/Data Dictionary/`
2. Upload the latest installer files for Windows and Mac clients to this location.

    >**Note:** Don't rename the files, otherwise the client upgrade won't work.

    Once the installer files are uploaded, users receive a notification telling them that an update is available and a 
    new installation file has been downloaded.

    Users will have to restart Desktop Sync to apply the new installation file.

    See [Updating Desktop Sync]({% link desktop-sync/latest/upgrade/index.md %}) for more information about how an update is applied.

## SAML authentication

Starting from version 1.4, Alfresco Desktop Sync users can authenticate through a SAML identity provider.

The following prerequisites are required - see the [Supported platforms]({% link sync-service/latest/support/index.md %}) page for specific versions:

* Alfresco Content Services
* Alfresco Sync Service
* Identity Service

SAML authentication in Desktop Sync clients (Windows and Mac) is automatically enabled if the 
Alfresco Content Services repository is configured to use the Identity Service.

See the Alfresco Sync Service documentation for [SAML configuration]({% link sync-service/latest/config/index.md %}#saml-configuration) details.

Once users have entered the repository URL (shown in step 2 of [Setting up Desktop Sync]({% link desktop-sync/latest/install/index.md %}#setting-up-desktop-sync-on-windows) for Windows and [Setting up Desktop Sync]({% link desktop-sync/latest/install/index.md %}#faq/mac) for Mac), they will be asked to enter their username and password into the SAML provider login page via their default browser.

> **Note:** In earlier versions of Desktop Sync, the user was logged out every 30 minutes and needed to enter their credentials again to re-authenticate. Starting from Desktop Sync 1.17, the logged in session will not terminate unless the system has unforeseen issues.

## Manage sync configuration

As an IT administrator, you can manage the configuration of your Desktop Sync client apps via the Desktop Sync UI and a configuration file. You can choose to enable or disable the content selection dialog from the UI for all your Desktop Sync clients, while setting enforced paths to sync from the configuration file.

The content selection dialog is displayed by default. The property that controls if this dialog appears is `syncui.enableManageContent` which is `true` by default. If you want to hide the whole dialog, change the value of the property to `false`, so that the user is only prompted to set the sync target location. Next, define enforced sync paths as described in [Manage enforced sync](#manage-enforced-sync).

The property to *enable/disable the content selection dialog* is specified as:

```text
syncui.enableManageContent = <true/false>
```

* The property defaults to `true`, even if it's not specified.

* If there are enforced sync paths in the configuration file and the content selection dialog is enabled, those path are always marked as checked/unchecked in the UI as specified in the configuration file.

* If there are no valid enforced sync paths from the configuration file (i.e. paths that exist and that the user can access), the value for this property is automatically set to `true`. So the value from the configuration file isn't taken into account, and the content selection dialog is enabled.

> **Note:** A special case that's worth highlighting from the last comment is where you can't add a folder as a constraint that's already covered by an enforced sync path. For example, setting the following values results in the content selection dialog being displayed, even though the `syncui.enableManageContent` property is set to `false`, since it would result in there being no valid paths to sync:
>
> ```text
> syncui.enableManageContent = false
>
> # Enforced sync path
> test.path.1 = /User Homes/username/folder1
>
> # Incorrect sync path to exclude - results in no valid paths to sync
> test.excludePath.1 = /User Homes/username
> ```

## Manage enforced sync

If you're an IT administrator, you can configure Desktop Sync client apps to enforce the sync of specific paths or Sites, and optionally enforce the exclusion of sub-folders for those paths or Sites. This allows you to restrict what your Desktop Sync clients sync by pre-selecting the sync folders.

When you add this configuration, users can't select anything to sync as the Desktop Sync client hides the content selection dialog.

The properties to *enforce sync* are specified as:

```text
test.path.<n> = <enforced-sync-path>
test.siteName.<n> = <enforced-sync-siteId>
```

where `<n>` is an ascending index number starting at `1`. These must be consecutive otherwise, if a number is skipped, all paths that follow are ignored.

The properties to *enforce exclusion* are specified as:

```text
test.subfolderFilter.<enforced-sync-path> = <relative path to folder to be excluded>
test.subfolderFilter.<enforced-sync-siteId> = <relative path to folder to be excluded>
```

Here's an example of how these properties are configured:

```bash
test.path.1 = /Shared
test.path.2 = /Sites/siteId/documentLibrary/folder3
test.path.3 = /User Homes/username
test.subFolderFilter./Shared=folder8,folder9
test.subFolderFilter./User Homes/username=folder7
```

> **Note:**
>
> * The exclusion property `test.subfolderFilter` can't be used on its own - it needs to be applied to one of the paths specified by `test.path.<n>`.
> * If all enforced sync paths are specified incorrectly, then the content selection dialog is enabled.
> * If, for example, one of two paths is invalid and one is valid, the content selection dialog is disabled and only the valid path is synced.
> * If an excluded folder is renamed, then that folder will be synced after a restart.

## Manage hidden sync

If you're an IT administrator, you can configure Desktop Sync client apps to hide specific paths or Sites. This allows you to restrict what your Desktop Sync clients can sync by hiding those locations from view in the content selection dialog.

The properties to *hide content from sync* are specified as:

```bash
test.excludePath.<n>=<full-path-to-folder-or-site>
test.excludeSite.<n>=<siteId>
```

where `<n>` is an ascending index number starting at `1`.

Adding this configuration ensures that users aren't able to sync the defined content. In addition:

* The folder/site will not be shown in the content selection dialog.
* If the excluded folder is inside a synced path, the excluded folder will be skipped when syncing.
* The sync folder selection is checked every time the Desktop Sync client restarts. If a sync location is hidden by the administrator, then that content is removed from the client.
---
title: Configure Desktop Sync
---

If you're an IT administrator, you can configure Desktop Sync for central installation purposes using the `AlfrescoSync.conf` file located at:

* (Windows): `<userHome>\AppData\Local\Alfresco`
* (For Mac): `~/Library/Application Support/Alfresco`

Using the configuration file, you can update:

* timer values, such as polling and retry intervals
* sync constraint patterns for files/folders to be ignored by Desktop Sync
* disk space limits
* custom content type mappings for particular file extensions
* user interface defaults and customization (including localization)
* network access configuration
* debug logging
* [timezone](#change-timezone) used in `AlfrescoDesktopSync.log` file

The configuration properties values are case sensitive and use the format `name.subname=value`, 
for example, `syncmanager.deferFileSyncTimer=15`.

## Sharing files

You can configure a file sharing URL, (defined by `syncmanager.quickShareURL`), so that when you share a link to a file, 
a correctly formatted URL is provided. This link should either access Alfresco Digital Workspace or Alfresco Share.

The format for this property is: `<protocol>://<yourserveraddress>/<path>/`, where:

* `<protocol>` is set to either `http` or `https`
* `<yourserveraddress>` is the address of the server
* `<path>` is the path to access a link in either Alfresco Digital Workspace or Alfresco Share

Here are examples of how you can set the URL to access a file:

* For Digital Workspace: `syncmanager.quickShareURL=https://workspace.mycompany.com/#/preview/s/`
* For Share: `syncmanager.quickShareURL=https://alfresco.mycompany.com/share/s/`

>**Note:** You must choose to share links either in Alfresco Digital Workspace or Alfresco Share but not both. 
>The URL must also use an `http` or `https` protocol. If the property is left blank or not set correctly, 
>the file sharing feature won't be available in Desktop Sync.

For more information, see [Sharing files]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/sharing.md %}).

## User interface

Use the user interface properties to configure the Desktop Sync UI.

|Property|Default value|Description|
|--------|-------------|-----------|
|syncui.defaultServer|Â |Specifies a default server URL to be entered in the login screen when Desktop Sync is run for the first time (usually at the end of the installation process).The user can change the URL on the login screen, if required.|
|syncui.enableAnalytics|true|Controls whether Alfresco Content Services collects anonymized data. Applies to Mac only.|
|syncui.language|Â |Add this property to specify the language for the Desktop Sync UI (requires app restart). See [Localization](#localization) for supported values.|
|syncui.showConsistencyCheck|true|Specifies whether the **Consistency Check** option is available in Desktop Sync.As an Administrator, you can disable this option as consistency check scans all the folders that are synced to Desktop Sync, and this may effect your server's performance. Applies to Windows only.|
|syncui.showMyFilesTab|true|Controls whether My Files is shown in the content selection dialog.|
|syncui.showSharedFilesTab|true|Controls whether Shared Files is shown in the content selection dialog.|
|syncui.showSitesTab|true|Controls whether Sites is shown in the content selection dialog.|
|syncui.showRepositoryTab|true|Controls whether Company Home is shown in the content selection dialog.|
|syncmanager.userMemberSitesMaxItems|250|Add this property to change the number of sites shown in the content selection dialog.|
|syncui.enableAspects|Â |Controls which aspects are shown in the **Property** dialog.Format: `syncui.enableAspects=<aspect1>,<aspect2>, ...`|
|syncui.disableProperties|Â |Controls which properties are hidden for a given aspect.Format: `syncui.disableProperties.<index>=<aspect>|<property1>,<property2>, ...`|
|syncui.fileCustomTypes|Â |Controls the file custom types that are visible in the **Property** dialog. Format: `syncui.fileCustomTypes=display_name (type_id),...`. Note that the display name is optional.|
|syncui.folderCustomTypes|Â |Controls the file custom types that are visible in the **Property** dialog. Format: `syncui.fileCustomTypes=display_name (type_id),...`. Note that the display name is optional.|

## Enable analytics (Mac only)

Alfresco Content Services collects some anonymized information about fatal errors and basic usage which are used to 
help us improve the product in the future. There's no data that could identify a customer, user, or machine. 
If you wish to prevent this anonymized data from being sent, change the value of the `syncui.enableAnalytics` property to `false` 
to turn it off.

Here are some examples of the information that's collected:

* Application crash logs
* Event metrics for specific features:
    * Conflict detected
    * Conflict resolved: Keep my changes, Discard my changes, error
    * Check out: success / error
    * Cancel check out: success / error
    * Check in: success / error, Has comment: yes / no, Major version: yes / no
    * Remove Account: Initial sync finished: yes / no, Has conflict: yes / no
    * Initial sync started

## Desktop Sync UI

As an IT administrator, you can control the parts of the Desktop Sync UI that users can access, 
so that they can't sync content from specific areas in Alfresco Content Services. 

By default, the content selection dialog (see [selecting content to sync]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/select-to-sync.md %})) 
displays **My Files**, **Shared Files**, **Sites**, and **Company Home**. 
If you want to hide any of these areas, change the value of the relevant `syncui.show*` property to `false`.

## View and edit properties

As an IT administrator, you can control which aspects and properties that your end users can view and edit from their desktops. 
By default, users can view and edit general properties for files or folders, such as the Title, Name, Description, and Author 
(if they have the correct permissions).

You can extend this functionality to allow users to view and edit additional properties. Add the `syncui.enableAspects` and 
(optional) `syncui.disableProperties` settings to your central configuration file.

>**Note:** We recommend adding `syncui.disableProperties` so that your end users aren't overwhelmed by properties they don't need to see, 
> such as system properties or potentially sensitive values.
>
>Here are a few examples:
>
>```bash
>syncui.enableAspects=cm:titled,exif:exif,dp:restrictable
>syncui.disableProperties.1=cm:titled|cm:title
>syncui.disableProperties.2=exif:exif|exif:exposureTime,exif:orientation,exif:flash
>```

As an IT administrator, you can also control the list of available custom types for files and folders that your end users 
can apply to their content from their desktops. If either `syncui.fileCustomTypes` or `syncui.folderCustomTypes` are missing 
from the configuration file, the custom types are fetched from the repository. 
Otherwise, the custom type field is populated with the values read from the configuration file.

In the **Property** dialog > **General properties** tab, there's a drop-down menu with the custom types that can be 
applied to a file or folder. This menu lists only custom types created using the Content Model Manager API.

Example:

```bash
syncui.fileCustomTypes=My custom type (model-1:custom_type_name)
```

>**Note:**
>
>* If a custom type is applied to the file/folder from the **Properties** dialog, all data entered that was not saved will be discarded. We suggest you save your changes first before applying a custom type.
>* If the file or folder already has a custom type applied, then the custom type drop-down will contain only sub-types of that custom type. You can't change between unrelated custom types, as the Content Model Manager API doesn't allow it.

## Sync manager timers

|Property|Default value|Description|
|--------|-------------|-----------|
|alfrescosync.initialPollInterval|15 seconds|Sets the number of seconds before the first server polling after application startup:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Minimum value: 0 seconds</li><li>Maximum allowed value: 18000 seconds (5 hours)</li></ul>{:/}|
|alfrescosync.pollingInterval|300 seconds|Sets the number of seconds between polling of the sync server for server-side file change events. This does not affect the processing of desktop file change events; they are always processed immediately:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Minimum value: 10 seconds</li><li>Maximum allowed value: 18000 seconds (5 hours)</li></ul>{:/}|
|syncmanager.deferFileSyncTimer|15 seconds|Sets the number of seconds between retries of a deferred update for a file, such as when an application still has the file open:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Minimum value: 10 seconds</li><li>Maximum allowed value: 60 seconds</li></ul>{:/}|
|syncmanager.deferDelayRetryTimer|3600 seconds|Sets the number of seconds to retry syncing a deferred update for a file. If you wish to override the default setting, add this property in the configuration file:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Minimum value: 10 seconds</li><li>Maximum allowed value: 36000 seconds (10 hours)</li></ul>{:/}|
|syncmanager.deferOnlineCheckTimer|60 seconds|Sets the number of seconds between retries when a server connection is offline. This may be due to server being down, no network connection, or no route to the server:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Minimum value: 15 seconds</li><li>Maximum allowed value: 600 seconds</li></ul>{:/}|
|syncmanager.consistencyCheckRetryInterval|120 seconds|Sets the number of seconds between consistency check retry attempts. A consistency check may be aborted when too many file system changes are received during the consistency check scan:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Minimum value: 30 seconds</li><li>Maximum allowed value: 3600 seconds</li></ul>{:/}|
|syncmanager.freeSpaceCheckTimer|120 seconds|Sets the number of seconds between free space checks when syncing has been paused due to the local free disk space threshold being reached:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Minimum value: 15 seconds</li><li>Maximum allowed value: 1800 seconds</li></ul>{:/}|

## Sync manager constraints

Use the sync constraints configuration section to specify desktop files and folders that should not be 
synced to the server, such as temporary files or work files.

Constraint rules are specified as `syncmanager.constraint.<n>=<rule>`, where:

* `<n>` is an ascending number starting at one
* `<rule>` is specified as `<ruletype>|<parameter>[,<parameter>,...]`

The available constraint rule types are:

|Constraint rule type|Description|
|--------------------|-----------|
|FileExt|Ignores files with a particular file extension. Multiple extensions can be specified per rule.|
|Name|Ignores files with a particular name. Multiple names can be specified per rule.|
|NamePattern|Ignores files that match a regular expression. Multiple regular expressions can be specified per rule.|
|FolderNamePattern|Ignores folders that match a regular expression. Multiple regular expressions can be specified per rule.Â |

Here is a sampleÂ sync constraints configuration section:

```bash
# Sync constraints

syncmanager.constraint.1=FileExt|.tmp,.temp
syncmanager.constraint.2=Name|desktop.ini,thumbs.db,.DS_Store
syncmanager.constraint.3=NamePattern|~\\$.*\\.doc,~\\$.*\\.docx,~\\$.*\\.xlsx,~\\$.*\\.pptx,~\\$.*\\.xls,~\\$.*\\.ppt,~\\$.*\\.xlsm
syncmanager.constraint.4=NamePattern|\\._.*
syncmanager.constraint.5=NamePattern|^[0-9A-F]{8}
syncmanager.constraint.6=FolderNamePattern|^[0-9A-F]{8}
```

## Disk space limits

Desktop Sync is initially configured to only sync content when the available disk space on a computer is above a 
specific limit (defined by `syncmanager.freeSpaceLimit`). By default value, the minimum amount of free space required 
is set to 3GB. Below this value, Desktop Sync will pause syncing, until the available disk space reaches an 
upper limit (`syncmanager.freeSpaceRestart`). When the available disk space reaches this value, syncing will restart. 
The default value for restarting sync is set to 3500MB (or 3.5GB).

If you wish to override the default settings, add these entries to your configuration file with new values:

```bash
# Free space limits
    
syncmanager.freeSpaceLimit=3G
syncmanager.freeSpaceRestart=3500M
```

>**Note:** Since floating point values aren't valid, you can set a property value to `3500M` (that's 3500MB) 
>to represent 3.5GB. Also, `syncmanager.freeSpaceRestart` should have a higher value than `syncmanager.freeSpaceLimit`.

The free space properties are specified as `syncmanager.freeSpace<Property>=<value>[<scale>]` where:

* `<value>` is an integer
* `<scale>` provides optional scaling using `K|M|G|T` for kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, and terabyte values
* add `+/-` in front of the `<value>` to specify values relative to the currently available free space: '+' specifies the limit above the currently available disk space; '-' specifies the limit below the currently available disk space.

To specify a simple limit, without using any scaling, use this example:

```bash
syncmanager.freeSpaceLimit=1073741824
```

In this example, the minimum amount of disk space required for content syncing is set to 1GB.

To specify relative values above the current available disk space, use this example:

```bash
syncmanager.freeSpaceLimit=+2G
syncmanager.freeSpaceRestart=+2500M
```

In this example, the `freeSpaceLimit` is set 2GB above the available space and the `freeSpaceRestart` is set 2.5GB above the current available space. So if you have 3GB of free disk space and your `freeSpaceLimit` is set 2GB, when the free space on your hard drive reaches 5GB, sync will pause. Sync only resumes once your hard drive has 5.5GB of free space.

You can also specify relative values below the current available disk space, use this example:

```bash
syncmanager.freeSpaceLimit=-3G
syncmanager.freeSpaceRestart=-3500M
```

In this example, the `freeSpaceLimit` is set 3GB below the available space and the `freeSpaceRestart` is set 3.5GB below the current available space.

## Force maximum size for user sync

You can limit the amount of data that a user can select to sync by setting `syncmanager.maxSyncSize` to `10` bytes or more. This property is only checked in the content selection dialog. When this is set and the data to sync exceeds the limit, you'll be notified in the content selection dialog, and the **Sync** button is disabled.

The `syncmanager.maxSyncSize` property is specified as:

```bash
syncmanager.maxSyncSize=<number of bytes greater than 10>
```

> **Note:**
>
> * If the size is set to `0` or less than `10` bytes, then no limit is set.
> * The value of the property must be an integer followed by one character: `K|M|G|T` for kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, and terabyte values (where 1K = 1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes).
> * If the value is not set correctly, then the maximum size limit defaults to bytes. For example, if there's an illegal character in the value, like `12W345K`, then the limit will be set to just `12` bytes.

## CMIS transfers

Use the CMIS transfer properties to control problems with slow or stalled data transfers when Desktop Sync is 
downloading or uploading content to/from the Alfresco Content Services CMIS server.

|Property|Default value|Description|
|--------|-------------|-----------|
|cmis.lowSpeedTime|30 seconds|Specifies the number of seconds of low speed transfer that are required for a data transfer to be aborted.|
|cmis.lowSpeedLimit|1 bytes per second|Specifies the number of bytes per second that is considered to be a slow data transfer.|
|syncmanager.resumeDownloadFileSize|500K|Specifies the size limit above which a download will resume. Default value is 500KB.|

## CMIS content type mappings

When files are uploaded to the Alfresco Content Services CMIS server they should have a mimetype associated with them. 
Desktop Sync contains a list of built-in file extension to mimetype mappings, but in some cases it may be necessary 
to add new mappings or override existing mappings.

The CMIS content type mappings are specified as `cmis.contentType.<n>=<extension>,<mimetype>`, 
where `<n>` is an ascending number starting at one.

Here is a sample CMIS content type mapping configuration section:

```bash
# CMIS content type mappings

cmis.contentType.1=pptx,application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
cmis.contentType.2=test,application/test
```

## Networking

|Property|Default value|Description|
|--------|-------------|-----------|
|net.SSLVerifyPeer|true|Specifies whether an SSL connection to the Alfresco server does full SSL verification. If the Alfresco server is using a self-signed certificate for SSL, the value must be set to `false`.|
|net.syncServer.SSLVerifyPeer|true|Specifies whether an SSL connection to the sync server does full SSL verification. If the sync server is using a self-signed certificate for SSL, the value must be set to `false`.|

## Debug logging

Desktop Sync can generate a lot of debug information or error level logging information.

The log output configuration contains two sections.

Use the first section to setup the log location, default logging level, formatting, rotation, and compression.

Here is a sample logging configuration section:

```bash
# Logging

logging.loggers.root.channel = c1
logging.loggers.root.level = error
logging.channels.c1.class = FileChannel
logging.channels.c1.path = ${alfresco.configDir}/AlfrescoDesktopSync.log
logging.channels.c1.formatter.class = PatternFormatter
logging.channels.c1.formatter.pattern = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%c %N[%P]:%s:%q:%t
logging.channels.c1.rotation=daily
logging.channels.c1.compress=true
logging.channels.c1.purgeAge=7 days
logging.channels.c1.archive=timestamp
logging.formatters.f1.class = PatternFormatter
#logging.formatters.f1.formatter.pattern = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%c %N[%P]:%s:%q:%t
logging.formatters.f1.times = UTC
```

This logging configuration will create a log file calledÂ `AlfrescoDesktopSync.log`Â in theÂ following folder:

* Windows: `<userHome>\AppData\Local\Alfresco`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Alfresco`

The log files are rotated daily and the old log files are compressed. Only the last 7 days of log files are kept.

Use the later section of the log output configuration to enable debug output from different components of Desktop Sync. 
This is done by configuring individual logging levels as shows below:

```bash
logging.loggers.l<n>.name = <logging level name>
logging.loggers.l<n>.level = <debug|error>
```

where `<n>` is an ascending index number starting at one. Both the configuration lines must use the same index number.

The available debug logging levels are:

## Change timezone {#change-timezone}

The default timezone used in the `AlfrescoDesktopSync.log` file is `UTC`. As an IT administrator, if you want to change this so that the log file uses your local timezone, edit the configuration file:

1. Remove the line `logging.formatters.f1.times = UTC`.
2. Add the following lines:

    ```bash
    logging.channels.c1.formatter.times = local
    logging.formatters.f1.times = local
    ```

3. Restart the Desktop Sync client, and open the log file to see the changes.

## Localization

Desktop Sync supports 16 languages across the user interface, notifications and right-click context menu. 
The language is automatically set based on your computer locale settings, but this can be overridden by 
adding one of the following `syncui.language` values:

|Language|Value (Windows)|Value (Mac)|
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
|English (US)|en|en|
|Brazilian Portuguese|pt-BR|pt\_BR|
|Czech|cs-CZ|cs|

title: Compatibility with Alfresco Governance Services
---

Desktop Sync is fully compatible with Alfresco Governance Services. 
This topic explains how Desktop Sync handles records and classified files.

## Initial content sync

Sites and folders available to synchronize may already include files that have been 
declared as records and/or files that are classified. When synchronization starts, the files are treated as follows:

* **Classified Files** are not synchronized to any users desktops
* **Records** are synchronized as read-only files, which can't be edited on the desktop
* The Records Management File Plan is not available to synchronize

## Content synchronization

Once the initial synchronization is completed, Governance actions are treated in specific ways:

* When a file is **Classified** then it's removed from users desktops
* Files that are **Declared as Records** are synchronized as ready only
* If a Classified file is **Declassified** then synchronization will resume
* If a record is **Rejected**, then its editable state will return where user permissions are sufficient

## Desktop record declaration

Files can be declared as records from within Windows Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).

* Windows: Right-click the file and select **Declare as Record** under **Alfresco Sync**
* Mac: Right-click the file and select **Declare as Record**

>**Note:** **Declare as Record** is not available with Alfresco One 5.1.

## Hidden records

Records that are hidden from a collaboration site are removed from users desktops.

title: Application icons and menu
---

The following sections describe the Desktop Sync icons and menu actions on Windows and Mac.

{% capture windows %}

### Desktop Sync icons

Desktop Sync always ensures that the files in your `C:\Users\<username>\Alfresco` folder are synced with Alfresco. It adds status icons to your files and folders so you know the application is working.

You'll see icons in two different places: in the system tray and over individual files and folders.

#### System tray icons

Icons that appear over the Desktop Sync icon in your system tray represent the overall status of your `Alfresco` folder. Here's what each of these icons means.

|Icon name|System tray icon|Description|
|---------|----------------|-----------|
|Green tick|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-greentick.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|A green tick shows all your files are synced and accessible from your desktop.|
|Red cross|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-redcross.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|A red cross indicates there are conflicts that need to be resolved by the user. Something isn't working properly and your file(s) are not being synced.|
|Pause|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-pause.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|A pause icon indicates that Desktop Sync is paused due to invalid server credentials or there's nothing configured to sync.|
|Warning|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-hcfail-mac.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|A warning icon indicates that either:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Desktop SyncÂ failed to get a successful server health check. Contact your IT team if you see this warning when you're having problems working with your files.</li><li>An update is available for Desktop Sync (i.e. the installed version is older than the one provided by your IT team).</li></ul>{:/}|
|Offline|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-offline-mac.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|An offline icon indicates thatÂ Desktop SyncÂ isn't connected to Alfresco and you are working offline. Check your Internet connection to resume syncing your files.|

#### Context menu icons

Icons that appear over individual files and folders represent the status of that file or folder. Here's what each of these icons means.

|Icon name|Context menu icon|Description|
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
|Green tick|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-ico-synced.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|It's synced - A green tick on a file indicates that the file or folder is in sync with the server copy.|
|Refresh arrows|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-ico-pending.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|It's in use - Blue arrows indicate that Desktop Sync is waiting for the application to release the file or for free space to become available, or a server file to be checked in.|
|Red flag|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-ico-conflict.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|It's in conflict - A red cross on a file or folder indicates that update/rename/delete has conflicted with a server-side change and we were not able to automatically resolve it. You need to decide which version to keep.|
|Grey arrow|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-ico-checkedout-other.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|It's checked out by another user. A grey arrow indicates that the file is checked out by another user in Alfresco. The file is locked, so you can't make changes until the file is checked in, or the check out is cancelled.|
|Blue arrow|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-ico-checkedout.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|It's checked out by you. A blue arrow indicates that the file is checked out by you. The file is locked on the server, so others can't make changes until the file is checked in, or the check out is cancelled.|
|Grey pencil|![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-ico-readonly.png %}){:height="35px" width="35px"}|It's read-only. A grey pencil indicates that you don't have permission to edit this file. This could be due to insufficient privileges on the server, or the file has been declared as a record.|

title: Desktop Sync FAQ
---

Here's a list of common questions about Desktop Sync for Windows and Mac.

{% capture windows %}

### So, what gets synced?

Desktop Sync shows you all your Alfresco sites and folders which you have access to, plus your My Files and Shared Files content. You can select any (or all) of these and click **Sync** to create a local copy of the content on your computer.

Individual files you've favorited aren't displayed and can be synced directly, you need to sync the folder they're in.

Whenever you update any of this local content (which includes adding, moving, and deleting files and folders within the synced area) these changes will automatically be replicated on Alfresco.

Whenever you or anyone else make changes in Alfresco to sites or folders that you've synced with, then these changes will be replicated in your local content.

>**Note:** Some temporary files don't get synced. These include, but aren't limited to \*.tmp, \*.temp, desktop.ini, \*.~, and Thumbs.db files. You can configure the file types you don't want to be synced in AlfrescoSync.config. For more information, see [Client configuration]({% link desktop-sync/latest/config/index.md %}).

### Can I use Desktop Sync during initial sync?

Yes. During initial sync, a content created on your desktop will be synced only after the initial sync is over.

### Will syncing happen while I am offline?

Sync needs a connection to the server. Syncing will resume when the connection is restored.

### Where can I find my synced files?

The content is synced to `C:\Users\<username>\Alfresco`, by default, or whatever location you chose after the initial setup. The `Alfresco` folder can also be found in File Explorer under **Favourites**.

### How many folder levels can I sync?

You can sync as many folder levels but the maximum length for a path should not be more than 260 characters. This is a limitation of the Windows File System.

For more information see [Maximum Path Length Limitation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file?redirectedfrom=MSDN#maxpath){:target="_blank"}.

### Can I cancel initial sync?

Yes. As a Desktop Sync user, you can either:

* Take your machine offline: You can simply ignore initial sync and shut down your machine or disconnect the network. Initial sync will resume when connection is restored.
* Keep your machine running but discontinue initial sync: You can quit Desktop Sync and initial sync will resume when restart Desktop Sync.
* Amend your selected content choices by clicking **Return to content selection**.

### I made changes to a local file that aren't showing in Alfresco.

A number of scenarios can cause this:

* The file is held/locked open by an application on your computer.
* Network connection problems, Alfresco connection problems, or synchronization service connection problems; contact your IT team.
* If you've made changes locally that are showing in Alfresco, then make sure that Desktop Sync is running by confirming that the ![Menu bar]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-alfresco.png %}) icon is showing in the system tray.
* It's also possible that someone was updating the content in Alfresco at the same time as you were updating the local content. The file is in conflict state. See sync conflict resolution guide for [Windows]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/sync-conflict-guide.md %}#resolve-and-manage-sync-conflicts-on-windows).

### What's the *orphaned* folder in my local synced drive?

If you deselect synced content in Desktop Sync and click **Sync**, then you're effectively breaking the link between local content and Alfresco content.

The content won't be synced any more. Files that were not synced to Alfresco due to conflict or deferred can be found in *orphaned* folder. This folder is automatically created in your synced area and the previously synced content is moved to there.

### If a file is checked out by another user in Alfresco, can I update it?

No, you can't update files that are checked out by other users.

### When will a deferred file be synced?

First you need to find the reason why the file is in a deferred state. The file can be in a deferred state for the following reasons.

* When you don't have free space on your desktop.
* If you have an Office file open and you are saving it to your local.
* You're not connected to the server.

Resolve the issue and your file will be synced automatically.

### I see a red cross on my system tray. What does that mean?

See [App icons and context menu]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/app-icons.md %}#application-icons-and-menu-on-windows).

See also sync conflict resolution guide on [Windows]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/sync-conflict-guide.md %}#resolve-and-manage-sync-conflicts-on-windows).

### Do I need to restart Desktop Sync when I restart my machine?

No, Desktop Sync is automatically started when your machine starts.

### Can I use Desktop Sync while I am offline?

You can continue working on your files offline and they'll be synced to Alfresco whenever you have a connection to the server.

### What happens to a file/ folder which is moved out of Alfresco folder on my desktop?

The moved file or folder is deleted in Alfresco.

### Why can't I see status icons on my files and folders?

Windows has a limit of 15 icon overlay handlers, some of which are reserved by the system. 
The number of different icon overlay handlers is limited by the amount of space available for icon overlays 
in the system image list. So, uninstalling other applications that use system overlays could make some slots 
available for Desktop Sync icon overlays.

Additionally, check if you have accidentally quit Desktop Sync. Upon restart, the icons should be restored.

See [application icons]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/app-icons.md %}#application-icons-and-menu-on-windows) 
for more details.

### What happens if two Alfresco sites have the same name?

If the site name is duplicate, one of the site name will be displayed as SiteName_01, for example, Test Site_01.

### What happens if the site name is invalid or contains unsupported Windows characters?

A file name can't contain the following characters: `\ / : * ? " < >`. Desktop Sync replaces these characters with underscores, for example, Test\>test will be replaced as Test_test on your desktop.

### How do I uninstall Desktop Sync?

1. Open **Programs and Features** by clicking **Start**.
2. Click **Control Panel**.
3. Under **Programs**, click **Uninstall a program**.
4. Select Desktop Sync, and then click **Uninstall**.

### Can Desktop Sync be installed in an unattended mode?

Yes.

### Can I setup Desktop Sync using a central installation process?

Yes, Desktop Sync installer contains an MSI, which can be used with any central installation tool, such as Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager.

### I'm running Windows in a Virtual Machine. Why is the automatic update for the configuration file not working correctly?

This is due to folder paths in some virtual machines being non-standard Windows paths.

### I'm running Windows in a Virtual Machine. Why is the automatic update not installing correctly?

The download folder path in some virtual machines is a non-standard Window path, and the installer isn't able to start.

### Upon unselecting, not all files are getting removed. What's wrong?

When a file of folder is locked by Windows File Explorer, applications, like Desktop Sync, can not remove that file and folder. In that case, when unsubscribing content or removing the application, some files and folders maybe left behind. They should be removed manually.

### Where do I find the Desktop Sync log file?

If you're having any issues with Desktop Sync then your Alfresco Administrator might ask you to provide the log file.

You can find the log file in the following locations, but be aware that it's a hidden file. If you don't know how to view hidden files then your Alfresco Administrator can help you.

* Windows - `C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\AlfrescoSync.log`

Additionally, you can use applications, such as DebugView to monitor debug output on your computer. To use DebugView, follow the steps below:

1. Download and install [DebugView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/debugview){:target="_blank"}.

    DebugView will immediately start capturing debug output.

2. On the top menu bar, click **Edit** and then **Filter/Highlight...**.

    The **DebugView Filter** window appears.

3. To filter and display only the output from the shell extension, specify `AlfrescoSyncExtension` in **Include** and click **OK**.

### I no longer need a site. How do I remove the site and its contents from my desktop?

Go to **Manage Folders** and deselect the sites you no longer need. Click **Sync** to remove the selected files and folders from your desktop.

### Can I use Desktop Sync while I am offline?

You can continue working on your files offline but they will get synced to Alfresco whenever you have a connection to the server.

### Will syncing happen while I am offline?

Sync needs a connection to the server. Syncing will resume when your connection is restored.

### Will my files be versioned in Alfresco?

Yes. All file updates in Alfresco using Desktop Sync are versioned.

### Can I recover a deleted file using Desktop Sync?

Yes. Any file deleted in Alfresco using Desktop Sync is moved to the Alfresco trash can.

### I have changed the site name in Alfresco. Can I continue using Desktop Sync?

Yes, you can continue working with Desktop Sync but the site name won't be updated in the File Explorer.

### Which file extensions are supported by Desktop Sync?

Desktop Sync syncs all file extensions except for the temporary file extensions mentioned below:

### If a file has a file extension which is in the exempted list above, can I include that file in the sync set?

Yes. In the `<userHome>\AppData\Local\Alfresco\AlfrescoSync.conf` file, in the Sync constraints section, 
update the `syncmanager.constraint.1=FileExt|.tmp,.temp` property

### What files should be backed up/restored on the client ?

You can find the synced data in the `C:\Users\<username>\Alfresco` folder. 
The sync client settings/database/logs can be found in the `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Alfresco` folder.

When the sync client starts up, it uses the modification time stamp from the `AlfrescoSync.time` file in the `AppData\Local\Alfresco` folder to check if any files/folders were changed while Desktop Sync was not running. If you delete and recreate the `AlfrescoSync.time` file after restoring the Desktop Sync data and settings, it would do a full scan of the local and remote folders.

### I have a new computer, is it possible to migrate my Alfresco sync folder to the new computer?

To avoid problems with conflicts on device registration, and content going out of sync during the migration process, you should first remove your account from the deprecated computer, and then setup Alfresco Desktop Sync on the new machine.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture mac %}

### So, what gets synced?

Desktop Sync shows you all your Alfresco sites and folders which you have access to, plus your My Files and Shared Files content. You can select any (or all) of these and click **Sync** to create a local copy of the content on your computer.

Individual files you've favorited aren't displayed and can be synced directly, you need to sync the folder they're in.

Whenever you update any of this local content (which includes adding, moving, and deleting files and folders within the synced area) these changes will automatically be replicated on Alfresco.

Whenever you or anyone else make changes in Alfresco to sites or folders that you've synced with, then these changes will be replicated in your local content.

> **Note:** Some temporary files don't get synced. These include, but aren't limited to `*.tmp`, `*.temp`, `desktop.ini`, `*.~`, and `Thumbs.db` files. You can configure the file types you don't want to be synced in `AlfrescoSync.config`. For more information, see [Configuring Desktop Sync]({% link desktop-sync/latest/config/index.md %}).

### Can I use Desktop Sync during initial sync?

Yes. During initial sync, any content created on your desktop will be synced only after the initial sync is over.

### Will syncing happen while I am offline?

Sync needs a connection to the server. Syncing will resume when the connection is restored.

### Where can I find my synced files?

The content is synced to `<userHome>/Alfresco`, by default, or whatever location you chose after the initial setup. The `Alfresco` folder can also be found in File Explorer under **Favourites**.

### How many folder levels can I sync?

You can sync as many folder levels on a Mac. This is only a limitation of the Windows File System, where the maximum length for a path should not be more than 260 characters.

### Can I cancel initial sync?

Yes. As a Desktop Sync user, you can either:

* Take your computer offline: You can simply ignore initial sync and shut down your computer or disconnect the network. Initial sync will resume when connection is restored.
* Keep your computer running but discontinue initial sync: You can quit Desktop Sync and initial sync will resume when you restart Desktop Sync.
* Amend your selected content choices by clicking **Return to content selection**.

### I made changes to a local file that aren't showing in Alfresco.

A number of scenarios can cause this:

* The file is held/locked open by an application on your computer.
* Network connection problems, Alfresco connection problems, or synchronization service connection problems; contact your IT team.
* If you've made changes locally that are showing in Alfresco, then make sure that Desktop Sync is running by confirming that the ![Menu bar]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-alfresco.png %}) icon is showing in the menu bar.
* It's also possible that someone was updating the content in Alfresco at the same time as you were updating the local content. The file is in conflict state. See sync conflict resolution guide for [Mac]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/sync-conflict-guide.md %}#faq/mac).

### What's the *orphaned* folder in my local synced drive?

If you deselect synced content in Desktop Sync and click **Sync**, then you're effectively breaking the link between local content and Alfresco content.

The content won't be synced any more. Files that weren't synced to Alfresco due to conflict or deferred can be found in the *orphaned* folder. This folder is automatically created in your synced area and the previously synced content is moved to there.

### If a file is checked out by another user in Alfresco, can I update it?

No, you can't update files that are checked out by other users.

### When will a deferred file be synced?

First you need to find the reason why the file is in a deferred state. The file can be in a deferred state for the following reasons.

* When you don't have free space on your desktop.
* If you have an Office file open and you're saving it to your computer.
* You're not connected to the server.

Resolve the issue and your file will be synced automatically.

### I see a red flag on my menu bar. What does that mean?

See [App icons and context menu]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/app-icons.md %}#faq/mac)

If a file is in conflict and the parent folder is also in conflict:

* You can only resolve the parent folder.
* You can't resolve the child as the Finder menu actions aren't visible.
* Any children in conflict are shown in an indented list below the parent.
* Once you select a resolution, the child is resolved using the same choice as the parent.

See also sync conflict resolution guide on [Mac]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/sync-conflict-guide.md %}#faq/mac).

### Do I need to restart Desktop Sync when I restart my computer?

No, Desktop Sync is automatically started when your computer starts.

### Can I use Desktop Sync while I am offline?

You can continue working on your files offline and they'll be synced to Alfresco whenever you have a connection to the server.

### What happens to a file/folder which is moved out of Alfresco folder on my desktop?

The moved file or folder is deleted in Alfresco.

### Why can't I see content icons on my files and folders?

If, for some reason, your content icons are hidden in Finder, you can make them visible by checking your **System Preferences**.

See [application icons]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/app-icons.md %}#faq/mac) for more details.

Additionally, check if you have accidentally quit Desktop Sync. Upon restart, the icons should be restored.

### What happens if two Alfresco sites have the same name?

If the site name is duplicated, one of the site names will be displayed as `SiteName_01`, for example, `Test Site_01`.

### What happens if the site name is invalid or contains unsupported characters?

A file name can't contain the following characters: `\ / : * ? " < >`. Desktop Sync replaces these characters with underscores, for example, `Test>test` is replaced by `Test_test` on your desktop.

### How do I uninstall Desktop Sync?

See [Uninstalling Desktop Sync]({% link desktop-sync/latest/install/index.md %}#faq/mac).

### Can Desktop Sync be installed in an unattended mode?

Yes.

### I'm running Windows in a Virtual Machine. Why is the automatic update for the configuration file not working correctly?

This is due to folder paths in some virtual machines being non-standard Windows paths.

### I'm running Windows in a Virtual Machine. Why is the automatic update not installing correctly?

The download folder path in some virtual machines is a non-standard Windows path, and the installer isn't able to start.

### Upon unselecting not all files are getting removed. What's wrong?

When a file or folder is locked by Finder, applications, like Desktop Sync, can't remove that file and folder. In that case, when unsubscribing content or removing the application, some files and folders maybe left behind. They should be removed manually.

### What is the Icon? file in the Alfresco Content Services sync folder?

`Icon?` is a hidden file that's used by Mac OS X toÂ putÂ the Alfresco Content Services logo on the `Alfresco`sync folder in Finder.

### Where do I find the Desktop Sync log file?

If you're having any issues with Desktop Sync, then your IT team might ask you to provide the log file.

You can find the log file in the following location, but be aware that it's a hidden file. If you don't know how to view hidden files, then your IT team can help you.

* `~/Library/Application Support/Alfresco/AlfrescoSync.log`

### Where do I find the Desktop Sync crash log file?

If Desktop Sync quits unexpectedly, a log file is generated that can help to 
identify potential issues on your Mac. To help troubleshoot the issue, your IT team may ask you to provide the crash log.

To find your crash logs follow these steps.

1. In Finder, click on the **Go** menu and select **Go to Folder...**. A text field should appear in Finder.
2. Paste the path `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` into the text field and click **Go**.
3. In this folder, find all log files with filename `Alfresco*.crash`.
4. Send these files to your IT team.

### I no longer need a site. How do I remove the site and its contents from my desktop?

Go to **Settings > Manage Sync Folder** and deselect the sites you no longer need. Click **Sync** to remove the selected files and folders from your desktop.

### Can I use Desktop Sync while I am offline?

You can continue working on your files offline but they will get synced to Alfresco whenever you have a connection to the server.

### Will syncing happen while I am offline?

Sync needs a connection to the server. Syncing will resume when your connection is restored.

### Will my files be versioned in Alfresco?

Yes. All file updates synced in Alfresco using Desktop Sync are versioned.

### Can I recover a deleted file using Desktop Sync?

Yes. Any file deleted in Alfresco using Desktop Sync is moved to the Alfresco trashcan.

### Which file extensions are supported by Desktop Sync?

Desktop Sync syncs all file extensions except for the temporary file extensions mentioned below:

### If a file has a file extension which is in the exempted list above, can I include that file in the sync set?

Yes. In the `~/Library/Application Support/Alfresco/AlfrescoSync.conf` file, find the Sync constraints section, and update the `syncmanager.constraint.1=FileExt|.tmp,.temp` property.

### How are files with an unknown or no extension handled?

When a file is renamed in Alfresco Content Services to either an unknown extension (such as `.aaa`) or to remove the extension, it may not open on your computer. Since the file extension is used to associate programs with files, rename the file to a known extension to fix the file association so you can open the file.

### What files should be backed up/restored on the client?

You'll find the synced data in the `<userHome>/Alfresco` folder. The sync client settings/database/logs are in the `~/Library/Application Support/Alfresco` folder.

When the sync client starts up, it uses the modification time stamp from the `AlfrescoSync.time` file in the `/Application Support/Alfresco` folder to check if any files/folders were changed while Desktop Sync wasn't running. If you delete and recreate the `AlfrescoSync.time` file after restoring the Desktop Sync data and settings, it'll do a full scan of the local and remote folders.

### I have a new computer, is it possible to migrate my Alfresco sync folder to the new computer?

To avoid problems with conflicts on device registration, and content going out of sync during the migration process, you should first remove your account from the deprecated computer and then setup Alfresco Desktop Sync on the new machine.

---
title: Manage the properties for content
---

The following sections describe how to manage properties for your content on Windows and Mac.

{% capture windows %}

You can view, edit, and update file and folder properties (i.e. metadata) from the Windows Explorer menu actions.

By default, you can view and edit general properties, such as Title, Name, Description, and Author (if you have the correct permissions).

1. In your **Alfresco** synced folder, find the file or folder that you want to update.

2. Right-click the item and select **Properties**.

    A window appears displaying a number of properties. For example:

    ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-properties-view-win-1.17.png %}){:height="491px" width="673px"}

    By default, the properties are read-only.

3. Click **Edit** to start editing the content.

    Note that the **Edit** button changes to **Save** (if you have edit permissions on the selected content).

4. In the **General properties** tab, you may see a **Custom Type** field. When custom types have been defined in the Desktop Sync configuration file by your IT team, you'll see them listed in this field.

    * To change the content type, select one from the available options, and then click **Apply**.

        Once you apply the change, a new tab appears with the name of the selected custom type.

    * Click **Edit** to start editing the content.

        > **Note:** If a custom type has already been applied to a synced file that's synced from the repository, and it has no sub-types (i.e. children), then you won't be able to change the type.

5. Click **Save** to update the content.

    New changes are shown in the properties panel for Share or Digital Workspace.

    >**Note:**
    >
    >* The **Edit** button is not available in the following cases:
    >    * If a file is declared as a record. See [Governance Services]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/ags.md %}) for more.
    >    * If your role is set to Consumer or Collaborator on files. See [Permissions]({% link desktop-sync/latest/using/permissions.md %}) for more.
    >* There are validation checks for all fields.
    >    * For example, if a property is incorrectly left blank when you click **Save**, a red background appears indicating that there's a problem. Correct the content to fix the problem.

### Bulk editing of properties

You can also edit properties (i.e. metadata) in multiple files simultaneously. The steps are similar to what's described earlier.

1. Select multiple files, right-click and select **Properties**.
   * This shows the common properties between all of the selected files.
2. You can now view and edit those common properties.

   For example, if you edit the `Title` field, that title will be updated in all of the selected files.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture mac %}

You can view, edit, and update file and folder properties from the Mac Finder menu actions.

By default, you can view and edit general properties, such as Title, Name, Description, and Author (if you have the correct permissions). If enabled by your IT team, you may be able to view and edit additional properties.

1. In your **Alfresco** synced folder, find the file or folder that you want to update.

2. Right-click the item and select **Properties**.

    A window appears displaying a number of properties. For example:

    ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-properties-view-mac2-1.17.png %}){:height="378px" width="690px"}

    By default, the properties are read-only.

3. Click **Edit** to start editing the content.

    Note that the **Edit** button changes to **Save** (if you have edit permissions on the selected content).

4. In the **General properties** tab, you may see a **Custom Type** field. When custom types have been defined in the Desktop Sync configuration file by your IT team, you'll see them listed in this field.

    1. To change the content type, select one from the available options, and then click **Apply**.

        Once you apply the change, a new tab appears with the name of the selected custom type.

    2. Click **Edit** to start editing the content.

        > **Note:** If a custom type has already been applied to a synced file that's synced from the repository, and it has no sub-types (i.e. children), then you won't be able to change the type.

5. Click **Save** to update the content.

title: Manage content permissions
---

Alfresco Content Services permissions are replicated on the desktop for files and folders that have been synchronized, ensuring that users are not able to edit files offline as well as on the server.

A role, as set in Alfresco, will determine what you can do to the files and folders. Each role in Alfresco has a default set of permissions. See [User roles and permissions]({% link content-services/latest/using/permissions.md %}) for more information about roles.

The roles are replicated on the desktop as follows:

|Role|Role Definition|Permissions|
|----|---------------|-----------|
|Manager|Full rights to all content|Managers will be able to create, edit, and delete files and folders that are synchronized where the Manager role is set - (*) **see note below**.|
|Collaborator|Full rights to content that they own; can edit but not delete content created by other users|Collaborators will be able to create new files/folders, edit, move, rename, and delete their own files/folders, edit other users content, but won't be able to rename/move/delete files/folders created by someone else - (*) **see note below**. They will be able to check-out/declare as record any file.|
|Contributor|Full rights to content that they own, but cannot edit or delete content created by other users|Contributors will be able to create new files/folders, edit, move, rename, and delete their own files/folders, but not files/folders created by someone else. Contributors won't be able to check-out/declare as record files created by other users. They will be able to check-out/declare records for their own files.|
|Consumer|View-only rights; cannot create content|Files and folders with the Consumer role will be set to read-only on the desktop.|

>**Important:** (*) Mac OS X and Windows don't have the same permissions granularity that Alfresco Content Services provides, so users will experience limitations on their desktops.
>The most notable differences are:
>
>* Specific permissions applied to a file that override the inherited permission from the folder. For example, a Consumer that's given Manager permissions on a file won't be able to rename, move, or delete the file.
>* Collaborators are only able to edit content that other users have created. Other actions, like rename or move are not permitted.

>**Note:** Role changes on content will synchronize from the server to the desktop.

>**Note:** Attempts to override locally set permissions are immediately reset, even when not connected to the server.

title: Select content to sync
---

Once you've set up Desktop Sync, all your Alfresco Content Services folders will be displayed from My Files, Shared Files, and your Sites.

{% capture windows %}

Once you've set up Desktop Sync, all your Alfresco Content Services folders are displayed from My Files, Shared Files, and My Sites.

Use the *Select sites and folders to sync* screen to select the content to sync between Alfresco Content Services and your desktop. The content is synced at `C:\Users\<username>\Alfresco`.

If you work with content that has deep folder structures, you may wish to deselect the **Include all files and sub-folders** checkbox. This allows you to only sync selected folders deep in your hierarchy, without syncing the intermediate folders, and prevent lengthy folder paths being created. By default, this feature is enabled, and if you want to sync only particular folders then the checkbox has to be deselected. In this case, only the files in the selected folders are synced using a folder structure starting from their respective root paths in Content Services (such as My Files, Shared Files, and your Sites).

Hereâ€™s an example that shows how the folder paths may be shortened:

* `My Files` > `<selected-sync-folder>`
* `Sites` > `<Site Name>` > `<selected-sync-folder>`
* `Shared Files` > `<selected-sync-folder>`

When the checkbox is selected (since it's enabled by default), the folders are synced using the hierarchy in Content Services. This replicates the behavior from previous releases of Desktop Sync.

> **Note:** The screen provides an estimate of how much disk space will be occupied, so only select the content you need. The more content you select, the more space will be taken on your local machine and the more time it will take to perform the initial sync.

1. Synchronize your content from **My Files** and **Shared Files**.

    ![Initial sync selection screen]({% link desktop-sync/images/setup-1.17.png %}){:height="555px" width="346px"}

    1. Select **My Files** to expand the folder list in your **My Files** area of Alfresco Content Services.

        You can navigate through the folder hierarchy and click the check box to select individual folders, or select ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-sync-fav.png %}) **My Files** to sync everything. See [My Files]({% link content-services/latest/using/content/index.md %}#my-files) for more.

    2. Select **Shared Files** to sync all the files and folders under **Shared Files** in Alfresco.

        You can navigate through the folder hierarchy and click the check box to select individual folders, or select ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-sync-fav.png %}) **Shared Files** to sync everything. See [Shared Files]({% link content-services/latest/using/content/index.md %}#shared-files) for more.

2. Select ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-sync-fav.png %}) next to **Favorite Sites** to sync all your favorite sites.

    To select specific sites, click ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-expand.png %}) to expand the list and select the relevant site.

    To sync a specific folder within a site, double-click the site name and select the folder.

3. Select ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-sync-fav.png %}) next to **Favorite Folders** to sync all your favorite folders.

    To sync specific folders, click ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-expand.png %}) to expand the list, double-click the site name and select the relevant folder.

    When you expand **Favorite Folders**, all the favorite folders for a site are grouped under that site.

4. Under **My Sites**, you'll see all the sites you're a member of.

    To sync specific folders, click ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-expand.png %}) to expand the list, double-click the site name and select the relevant folder.

    > **Note:** Sites display their full name and folders display the hierarchy of the folder, for example, **My Site \| My Folder**.

5. Under **Company Home**, you'll see all the folders created by the Administrator under Company Home of Alfresco repository.

6. Click **Sync** to start initial syncing of the selected Alfresco files and folders to your desktop.

    > **Tip:** You can click **Cancel** to cancel the sync and close the Select sites and folders to sync screen.

    > **Note:** During the initial sync, don't disconnect your computer from the network or put your computer to sleep. Although the sync will resume if interrupted, it will likely need to check the content again and very large initial syncs may take a long time to complete.

7. In the **Alfresco sync folder location** dialog, choose where the sync folder is stored.

    The content is synced to `C:\Users\<username>\Alfresco` by default.

    1. To use the default location and start the sync, click **OK**.

    2. To change the sync location, select **Browseâ€¦**, choose a new location, click **Select Folder**, and then click **OK** to start the sync.

    > **Note:** If you wish to move the Alfresco sync folder location later, you'll have to remove your account and set up Desktop Sync again.

    > **Note:** The sync folder location must be set to a local folder as network folders aren't supported.

### About the initial sync {#init-sync-win}

The **Sync** progress screen shows the status of initial sync. The Alfresco icon ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-spin.png %})in the system tray will spin during the sync process. On completion, a notification appears on the system tray.

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/initialsync-1.12.png %}){:height="160px" width="469px"}

In C`:\Users\<username>\Alfresco`, copies of all the content you've selected to sync are created. Desktop Sync automatically keeps both the local copy and the Alfresco versions in sync with each other whenever any changes are made.

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/sync.png %})

During initial sync:

* You can **Return to content selection** to change the content selected for synchronization. Note that after making changes, your sync will restart from the beginning.
* If you create a new file or update a file on your desktop, it will be synced only after the initial sync is over.
* It's recommended that you don't move the parent folders being synced.

### Working with content

To save your work in Alfresco, just work on your files in the `C:\Users\<username>\Alfresco` folder, and everything in the folder will be automatically synced to Alfresco.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture mac %}

Use the *Select sites and folders to sync* dialog to select the content to sync between Alfresco Content Services and your desktop. The content is synced to your `/<userHome>/Alfresco` folder, located in Finder under **Go > Home**.

If you work with content that has deep folder structures, you may wish to deselect the **Include all files and sub-folders** checkbox. This allows you to only sync selected folders deep in your hierarchy, without syncing the intermediate folders, and prevent lengthy folder paths being created. By default, this feature is enabled, and if you want to sync only particular folders then the checkbox has to be deselected. In this case, only the files in the selected folders are synced using a folder structure starting from their respective root paths in Content Services (such as My Files, Shared Files, and your Sites).

Hereâ€™s an example that shows how the folder paths may be shortened:

* `My Files` > `<selected-sync-folder>`
* `Sites` > `<Site Name>` > `<selected-sync-folder>`
* `Shared Files` > `<selected-sync-folder>`

When the checkbox is selected (since it's enabled by default), the folders are synced using the hierarchy in Content Services. This replicates the behavior from previous releases of Desktop Sync.

> **Note:** The screen provides an estimate of how much disk space will be occupied, so only select the content you need. The more content you select, the more space will be taken on your computer and the more time it'll take to perform the initial sync.

1. Synchronize your content from **My Files** and **Shared Files**.

    ![Initial sync selection screen]({% link desktop-sync/images/setup-mac-1.9.png %}){:height="382px" width="640px"}

    1. Select **My Files** to expand the folder list in your **My Files** area of Alfresco Content Services.

        You can navigate through the folder hierarchy and click the check box to select individual folders, or select ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-sync-fav.png %})**My Files** to sync everything. See [My Files]({% link content-services/latest/using/content/index.md %}#my-files) for more.

    2. Select **Shared Files** to expand the folder list in your **Shared Files** area of Alfresco Content Services.

        You can navigate through the folder hierarchy and click the check box to select individual folders, or select ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ico-ds-sync-fav.png %})**Shared Files** to sync everything. See [Shared Files]({% link content-services/latest/using/content/index.md %}#shared-files) for more.

2. Select **Sites** to expand the list of sites you are a member of in Alfresco Content Services, sites you have favorited, and sites with content that you have favorited.

    ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/sites-favorites-mac.png %}){:height="327px" width="640px"}

    * ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/site-fav-mac.png %}) indicates a favorite site or folder
    * ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/folder-fav-mac.png %}) indicates a site or folder that contains favorited content

    These are listed in alphabetical order, grouped by favorites, then sites with favorited content, and then other sites you're a member of.

    * Select **Sites** to expand the folder list in your **Sites** area of Alfresco Content Services.

       You can navigate through the folder hierarchy and click the check box to select individual folders.

    * Select **Company Home** to expand the folder list in your **Company Home** area of Alfresco Content Services (if set up by your IT team).

       You can navigate through the folder hierarchy and click the check box to select individual folders.

       > **Note:** It's not possible to select all your **Sites** or all of **Company Home** as it's likely to involve a large sync and may take a long time.

3. Click **Sync** to start initial syncing of the selected files and folders to your desktop.

    > **Tip:** You can click **Cancel** to cancel selecting content and close the Select sites and folders to sync dialog.

    > **Note:** During the initial sync, don't disconnect your computer from the network or put your computer to sleep. Although the sync will resume if interrupted, it's likely to need to check the content again, and very large initial syncs may take a long time to complete.

4. In the **Alfresco sync folder location** dialog, choose where the sync folder is stored.

    The content is synced to `<userHome>/Alfresco` by default.

    1. To use the default location and start the sync, click **OK**.

    2. To change the sync location, select **Browseâ€¦**, choose a new location, click **Select Folder**, and then click **OK** to start the sync.

    > **Note:** If you wish to move the Alfresco sync folder location later, you'll have to remove your account and set up Desktop Sync again.

    > **Note:** The sync folder location must be set to a local folder as network folders aren't supported.

### About the initial sync {#init-sync-mac}

The **Sync** progress dialog shows the status of the initial sync. The Alfresco icon in the menu bar changes to indicate that the sync is in progress ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-syncing-mac.png %}){:height="23px" width="23px"}. Once the sync has completed successfully, the icon changes to ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-synced-mac.png %}){:height="23px" width="23px"}.

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/initialsync-mac-1.17.png %}){:height="221px" width="469px"}

In `/<userHome>/Alfresco`, copies of all the content you've selected to sync are created. Desktop Sync automatically keeps both the local copy and the Alfresco Content Services versions in sync with each other whenever any changes are made.

![]({% link desktop-sync/images/sync-mac.png %}){:height="351px" width="747px"}

During initial sync:

* You can close the sync progress dialog using the red cross, and the initial sync will continue in the background which allows you to continue working elsewhere.
* You can **Return to content selection** to change the content selected for synchronization. Note that after making changes, your sync will restart from the beginning.
* If you create a new file or update a file on your desktop, it'll be synced after the initial sync is over.
* It's recommended that you don't move folders until the initial sync has completed.

### Working with content

To save your work in Alfresco, just work on your files in the `/<userHome>/Alfresco` folder, and everything in the folder will be automatically synced to Alfresco.

title: Resolve and manage sync conflicts 
---

Use the following information to resolve and manage Desktop Sync conflicts.

Whilst Desktop Sync ensures that content is kept up to date silently, under normal operation there may be circumstances where Desktop Sync can't resolve differences between a file stored on your desktop and the corresponding file in Alfresco.

When the sync changes can't be updated automatically you are asked to resolve the conflict manually. This happens when a file has changed in both locations since its last sync, making it difficult to determine which changes to save.

For example, a conflict occurs when you update a file in your `Alfresco` sync folder and an update to the same file has happened on the server since the last sync. Desktop Sync will give you a choice of resolving the sync conflict by either choosing to keep your changes, or discarding your changes in favor of the latest copy from Alfresco.

{% capture windows %}

A conflict may either be resolved automatically by Desktop Sync or may require you to do something.

You can view and manage the version history from the Windows Explorer/Mac Finder menu actions.

1. In your **Alfresco** synced folder, find the file that you want to update.

2. Right-click the item and select **Version History**.

    A window appears displaying the version history with a number of available actions. The latest version of the file is shown at the top of the left panel, with older versions listed below it (if available).

    For example on Windows:

    ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-history.png %}){:height="361px" width="498px"}

    For example on Mac:

    ![]({% link desktop-sync/images/ds-history-mac.png %}){:height="371px" width="684px"}

3. Click **Download** to download the selected version to your **Downloads** folder.

    The file name is saved using format `<filename>-<version.number>.<ext>`.

4. Click **Revert** to revert the content to the version selected in the left panel.

    A new minor version is created based on the selected version.

5. Click **Delete** to remove the selected version.

    New changes are shown in the properties panel for Share or Digital Workspace.

    >**Note:**
    >
    > * The default download location isn't changeable.
    > * You'll see a notification when reverting and deleting a version.
