title: Support Case Life Cycle
---

You have contacted Technical Support using [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"} or by telephone for a production down issue. So, what happens next?

Your support case is intelligently routed to an available and knowledgeable Support Analyst within Technical Support that can address the issue you're experiencing based on the issue summary and description provided when the case was created. The Analyst assigned will follow up to understand the impact the issue is having on your business, and to make sure they have the information needed to effectively troubleshoot the issue.

Depending on the complexity of the issue being experienced, the Support Analyst will follow up with you in various ways:

* If a resolution is quickly identifiable, the Analyst will update the case and assist you to implement the resolution.
* If they cannot resolve the issue quickly, or replicate the issue for further troubleshooting, the Analyst may request your assistance to gather additional information until they are able to replicate or have resolved the issue.
* If we identify the issue as a product defect, it is logged with Development and the Analyst assists them to prioritize the issue based on its business impact, with the items having the greatest impact to the customer base taking on the highest priority.

Good communication is essential for us to focus on your issue. For Technical Support to address your issue we may request additional information. A timely response is appreciated, as it will assist us in resolving your issue that much faster.

If at any point you are not satisfied with the progress being made toward case resolution, you can escalate your case by contacting Hyland's Customer Care Advocate (CCA) team via **Engage Customer Care** on Hyland Community.

A support case is closed and **Resolved** upon your sign off on the resolution. If the reported issue has not been seen before, the issue and resolution will be documented in our [Knowledge Base](https://community.hyland.com/tskb){:target="_blank"} to assist other customers who may encounter the same issue.

As the last step in the support case life cycle, when your case is closed you are sent a short survey designed to help us improve our service. Your feedback is important to us, and taking a couple of minutes to tell us how we did resolving your issue is greatly appreciated.

title: Contact Hyland Support
---

There are several ways to contact Hyland for assistance with your products and solutions. Hyland Support assistance descriptions follow; however, if you are experiencing an issue and are not sure who to contact, please submit a case via [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"} and Support will assist in connecting you with the right resource.

## Support Analysts

Support Analysts answer questions concerning Hyland's products and troubleshoot issues with your implemented products:

* Specific functionality (“How should this button work?”)
* Broken functionality (”I pressed this button and X should have happened, but I saw Y”)
* Broken public API calls

Active maintenance and support is required.

To contact Technical Support, please log into [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"} and navigate to **Support > Open Support Cases**. From this page you can submit a new support case, review the status of an existing support case, and comment on an open case to share information with the assigned Analyst.

Production down and emergency support issues should be reported to Technical Support by phone and are prioritized by the scope of impact. Phone contact information is located on the Community **Technical Support Contact Information** page.

## Global Services Consultants

Consultants help you to:

* Install, upgrade, and configure Alfresco product solutions in customer environments
* Build applications on top of Alfresco products
* Design and architect your Alfresco Digital Business Platform project
* Incorporate best practice advice
* Help identify issues that are intertwined with custom code before handing off to Support

Consultants work on a per day basis and their services must be purchased separately from maintenance and support. Partner consultants are arranged and billed through the Partner. You can arrange consulting hours through your normal Sales channel. For additional information, please contact your Hyland Account Executive for direction.

## Partner Enablement Team

The Partner Enablement Team helps Partners with their specific environment, general and pre-sales related questions. More information is available at [Partner Central](https://community.hyland.com/hyland-partners/){:target="_blank"}.
---
title: Escalate an Issue
---

Occasionally, an issue requires a faster response, more attention, and a deeper understanding of the impact on your business.

## Contact Customer Care Advocate Team

Please contact the Customer Care Advocate team to discuss the impact the issue is having to your business. If the issue pertains to a product defect, the business case surrounding the escalation. The business case should include any financial implications, as well as the impact for users. The Customer Care Advocate team will be your champion within Hyland and make sure the right people are engaged at the right time to deliver a resolution as quickly as possible.

Participation is a critical aspect of Technical Support’s ability to resolve issues quickly and effectively. Therefore, the Support team may request heightened assistance from you during the troubleshooting of an escalated issue. Your role includes identifying a key technical contact and making sure that at least one individual is available for the duration of troubleshooting an escalated issue.

## For The Most Serious Issues

For the most serious issues, the Support management will become involved. Examples are:

* Server down situation
* Critical business process down

Escalated scenarios should have an element of a significant business risk.

When Support management is engaged, they are responsible for ensuring the shortest possible resolution time through engaging the appropriate people and communicating the agreed action plans to stakeholders. They will proactively engage the senior executives, as appropriate.

title: Support Issue Resources and Case Logging
---

The [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com){:target="_blank"} has a variety of self-service tools. You can also log a support case in this portal.

The self-service tools are as follows:

* Knowledge Base

    The [knowledge base](https://community.hyland.com/tskb){:target="_blank"} is constantly growing, so we recommended that you search for solutions to common issues before logging a support case.

* Alfresco Product Documentation

    The officially supported [Alfresco Documentation](/) has all the current information on installing, configuring, using, administering, customizing, and extending the major versions of Alfresco products.

Should you not find your answer using the self-service tools, please log a support case using one of the following methods:

* Hyland Community Support Cases

    Hyland Support has a web interface that you can use to log a new support case, update an open existing case or review previously closed cases.

* Telephone - recommended logging method for Severity 1 issues

    For all issues, we recommend logging a support case first so we are looking at the same information you have in real-time.

---
title: Severity Definitions
---

The outlined Hyland Support severity definitions are utilized when prioritizing and working on your issue. Reserve communication of Severity Level One (1) for your most critical issues (production environment down) to ensure the Hyland Support team can respond to all issues appropriately.

| Severity | Definition |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Level 1 | "Level 1" means any Error that causes total or substantial software failure, which means that the software is down and the customer is unable to access the software in any way within their production environment. |
| Level 2 | "Level 2" means an Error that causes substantial software failure which prevents a portion of a customer’s users from accessing the software in any way within the production environment. |
| Level 3 | "Level 3" means that the software is usable except that an Error causes an ongoing, system-wide, severe performance degradation. |
| Level 4 | "Level 4" means that the software is usable except that an Error prevents a specific feature or functionality from working. |
| Level 5 | "Level 5" means that the software is usable except that an Error causes a trivial inconvenience and the task can be completed in another way. |
| Level 6 | "Level 6" means Technical Support Services. |

"Error" means any defect or condition inherent in the software which is reported by a customer and which is confirmed by Hyland, that causes the software to fail to function in any material respect as described in the documentation.

## Technical Support Services

Hyland will provide online or phone technical support related to problems reported by a customer and associated with the operation of any supported software, including assistance and advice related to the operation of the software.

> **Note:** Technical Support Services are not available for retired software.

## Error Correction Services

With respect to any Errors in the supported software which are reported by a customer and which are confirmed by Hyland, in the exercise of its reasonable judgment, Hyland will use its commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Error, which may be effected by a commercially reasonable workaround. Hyland shall promptly commence to confirm any reported Errors after receipt of a proper report of such suspected Error from a customer. Hyland may elect to correct the Error in the current available release, or in the next available commercially released version of the supported software and the resolution may require the customer to implement an upgrade and enhancement in order to obtain the correction.

> **Note:** Error Correction Services are not available for retired software.

title: Extensions and Integrations Support
---

Alfresco Content Services is a modular platform and offers certain capabilities in the form of **add-on extensions**, typically packaged as Alfresco Module Package (AMP) or as of Alfresco 5.1 as Alfresco Simple Modules (JAR), developed by Alfresco or by its Community ecosystem. We describe here the different types of extensions they support and compatibility.

## Type of Extensions

Extensions and integrations can be classified based on their provenience:

* **Alfresco Supported Extensions and Integrations**, developed by Alfresco and supported for Alfresco Customers
* **Alfresco Certified Technologies**, developed by Alfresco certified Partners, validated by Alfresco and supported for Alfresco Customers
* **Community Extensions and Integrations**, developed by the Alfresco Community and therefore not supported.
* **Alfresco Unsupported Extensions and Integrations**, extensions developed by Alfresco to showcase new features, promote feedback and highlight potential use cases and were never intended to be part of the core product, thus have not had formal QA or been fully documented, therefore are not supported.

## Alfresco Supported Extensions and Integrations

An AMP/JAR will only be supported if it is documented in the [Official Documentation online](/), since this will mean that it:

* Has been through a full QA cycle
* Support have the infrastructure to test and reproduce issues
* **Support status** is Full Support or Limited Support for the Module / Extension in the [Product Support Status](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/technical-support/product-support-status){:target="_blank"}

## Alfresco Certified Technologies

A Partner developed technology listed in the [Alfresco Integrations page](https://www.alfresco.com/ecm-software/integrating-extending-alfresco){:target="_blank"}, and it's supported by Alfresco and its Partner, since this will mean:

* Is validated and certified by Alfresco to work against the specific target Alfresco product version
* It implements Alfresco development best practices

## Community Extensions and integrations

An AMP/JAR developed by the Alfresco Community and therefore unsupported. The main hub to find Alfresco Community extensions and integrations is the [Alfresco Content Services - Add-ons](https://hub.alfresco.com/t5/alfresco-content-services-add/bd-p/add-ons){:target="_blank"} on the Alfresco Hub.

## Alfresco Unsupported Extensions and integrations

An AMP/JAR developed by Alfresco is considered to be unsupported if it is not documented in the [Official Documentation](/). In addition, the following will also be true:

* The module is not present or in KB Support in the [Product Support Status](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/technical-support/product-support-status){:target="_blank"} page.
---
title: Alfresco Content Services - API Support Policy
---

This page describes the Support and Backward compatibility Policy for all the supported in process and remote APIs / Extension Points provided for Alfresco Content Services. These policies are provided to ensure high longevity customizations and integrations with Alfresco Content Services.

## Supported APIs

Alfresco Content Services is an open source, open standard and open architecture platform allowing powerful extensions and integrations to be built against a comprehensive set of **APIs**.

Alfresco provides the following **supported APIs**:

* On the Alfresco Content Services platform side, build powerful Alfresco Content Services **extensions**:
  * Platform Public Java API
  * JavaScript API
  * FreeMarker API
  * [Platform Extension Points]({% link content-services/latest/develop/repo-ext-points/index.md %})
* On the Alfresco Share side, [Share Extension Points]({% link content-services/latest/develop/share-ext-points/index.md %}) to extend the Share UI functionality
* On the Alfresco repository side, integrate and build powerful content centric applications and integrations:
  * [REST/CMIS APIs]({% link content-services/latest/develop/rest-api-guide/index.md %})

These APIs are part of the Alfresco developer platform and should be used to extend Alfresco Content Services. The **API Support Status** is defined at API-set level and maintained in the [Product Support Status](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/technical-support/product-support-status){:target="_blank"} page.

> **Note:** Customizations and Integrations not using these supported APIs **cannot be supported by Alfresco**.

## Supported Extension Points

In addition to its APIs, Alfresco provides several way to extend the Alfresco Content Services Platform both at repository and UI level to power very different content centric processes and use cases.

Alfresco provides the following **Supported Extension Points**:

* [Platform Extension Points]({% link content-services/latest/develop/repo-ext-points/index.md %}) to extend out of the box Alfresco Content Services Platform functionality
* [Share Extension Points]({% link content-services/latest/develop/share-ext-points/index.md %}) to extend out of the box the Alfresco Share functionality

These Extension points are part of the Alfresco Developer platform and should be used to extend Alfresco Content Services. The **Extension Points Support Status** is defined per each Extension Point for [Platform]({% link content-services/latest/develop/repo-ext-points/index.md %}) and [Share]({% link content-services/latest/develop/share-ext-points/index.md %}).

> **Note:** Customizations and Integrations not using these supported Extension Points **cannot be supported by Alfresco**.

## Versioning and Backward compatibility

At Alfresco, we understand the need to provide an Enterprise Grade Platform, for building high longevity applications, which survive version upgrades and allow your business to evolve without the operational burden of re-developing, re-testing and re-deploying your customizations.

**For Alfresco 5.1 and above:** For every API and Extension Point, Alfresco provides the following versioning scheme and backward compatibility policy:

|API / Extension Points|Versioning|Backward Compatibility|
|----------------------|----------|----------------------|
|Platform Java Public API|Highly coupled with the Alfresco repository, it's not explicitly versioned and follows the version number of the underlying Alfresco repository.|No backward incompatible changes are allowed within an Alfresco repository family. <br><br>Incremental, backward compatible changes can be added in Alfresco repository releases (Service Pack versions).|
|Platform Extension points|Highly coupled with the Alfresco repository, it's not explicitly versioned and follows the version number of the underlying Alfresco repository.|No backward incompatible changes are allowed within an Alfresco repository family. <br><br>Incremental, backward compatible changes can be added in Alfresco repository releases (Service Pack versions).|
|Share Extension Points|Highly coupled with the Alfresco Share, it's not explicitly versioned and follows the version number of the underlying Alfresco Share product (for example, `7.x`)|No backward incompatible changes are allowed within an Alfresco Share family. <br><br>Incremental, backward compatible changes can be added in Alfresco Share releases (Service Pack versions).|
|REST / CMIS API|The Version of the REST API is independent from the underlying Alfresco repository version and follows a single digit incremental scheme. Current version: V1|Version `X` is Supported until Version `X+2` is released or 1 year after Version `X+1` is released (whichever is the earliest)|
---
title: Deployment and Containerization Support Policy
---

![Containerized deployment]({% link support/images/deployment-support.png %})

The above illustration shows four deployment options. Alfresco creates and supports only the software represented as App1, App2, and App3. Alfresco doesn't create or support anything else in the diagram - that's considered to be "infrastructure".

There are many different ways to deploy Alfresco software into an infrastructure before it can run. A few options include using custom shell scripts, installers, Ansible, Terraform, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Docker Enterprise, OpenShift, Heroku, Chef, Puppet, Rancher, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, Google Cloud Deployment Manager, AWS ECS, AWS EKS, and so on. Within this policy these are all considered to be "deployment tools".

Alfresco doesn't create or support any deployment tool, and customers may choose the deployment tool with which they feel most comfortable. Often this will be based on a company standard, and Alfresco expects that each customer will have its own unique standard. Each customer is responsible for having the skills and knowledge needed to use their chosen deployment tool effectively. Given the number of deployment tools available, it is not feasible for Alfresco to provide any assistance on the chosen deployment tool.

From time to time Alfresco may create and make available reference deployment scripts to help people be successful with a couple of the more-popular deployment tools. These reference scripts are supported by Alfresco, and if a defect is found in them or an enhancement is wanted then a ticket can be raised through Hyland Community. The customer is responsible for knowing how to use the deployment technology associated with these scripts, and they shouldn't use them if they don't. Alfresco is unable to offer training in the use of deployment tools.

As no two infrastructures are alike and everyone has their own set of deployment guidelines and best practice, when Alfresco does offer deployment scripts they're only references. Each customer is expected to adjust them to suit their own needs. Alfresco makes no representation that these reference scripts will meet any particular customer's specific standards.

When Alfresco provides reference images (either virtual machine images or container images) it will aim to update those images as the underlying operating system and libraries are released. However, as those images are built upon the work of others, Alfresco cannot give guarantees and assurances on the timeliness of upgrades and patches for security issues in those underlying components. As with any reference deployment scripts, any virtual machine or container images provided by Alfresco are considered references from which customers may derive their own, incorporating their own specific guidelines and best practices as needed.

Alfresco will support its software irrespective of how it's deployed, provided that it's using stack components listed on our product supported stack configurations. The supported stacks can be found at: [Supported Platforms and Languages](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/supported-platforms){:target="_blank"}.
---
title: Enhancement Policy
---

Alfresco accepts code contributions, improvements, suggestions, and recommendations for future releases. The Enhancement policy manages these items.

## What is an enhancement request

An enhancement request is a piece of functionality that was not specified at the time that the code was written, or an extension to what is already present. Undocumented functionality is considered an enhancement request.

## How are enhancement requests created

Enhancement requests are created by customers and partners through the **Feedback** page on Hyland Community. Feedback in Hyland Community is designed to facilitate innovation around Hyland products and solutions. Think of it as your connection to our Product Management team, your opportunity to influence the roadmap and to submit overall feedback. You can suggest product enhancements, and share a concept for something new. Please visit the [Community Feedback Portal Guide](https://community.hyland.com/en/help/documentation/reference-guide/Feedback){:target="_blank"} for more information.

## What happens to my enhancement requests

Enhancement requests are kept in a separate Engineering [project](https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/MNT){:target="_blank"}.

As the planning for a new release gets underway, enhancements requests are reviewed for consideration in the next release.

Once an enhancement request has been implemented, the original enhancement request is closed and the requester is notified.

## Can enhancement requests be escalated

If you are a customer or partner, then you can escalate your enhancement via the standard Customer Success and account management channels.

## Can I request an enhancement for a specific Alfresco product/version

Yes, if your product or version is in "Full Support" state. Please refer to the [Product Support Policy]({% link support/latest/policies/index.md %}) section for more details.
---
title: Hot Fix and Regression Escalation Policy
---

Some issues are so urgent that it is not possible to wait for the issue to be resolved in a future Service Pack. For these situations there may be an option of a Hot Fix (HF).

Be aware that some customers have a higher entitlement to make Hot Fix requests than others. For example:

* Premier - Premier Services customers have automatic entitlement to make HF requests.
* Standard – Standard support customer issues may also be considered for a HF, if the business case indicates that the issue has significant financial or operational impact.

For all requests, it is imperative that a business case is described to the Technical Account Manager, the Customer Success Manager or the Customer Care Advocate handling the escalation request, whereby the criticality is clear. You must explore and exhaust all possible workarounds, code changes, and back ports with the Support Analyst assigned to your case before requesting the HF.

In exceptional circumstances, if there is a high degree of confidence that the identified fix does not have unwanted side effects, and that it is feasible for Engineering to complete, a request can be made for a Hot Fix.

A Hot Fix is a full production build of the Alfresco product version that you are running, along with the requested fix. Hot fixes cannot be provided as JAR files: they are cumulative fixes of the Service Pack and any previous Hot Fixes. For example, Hot Fix `23.1.5` is the fifth Hot Fix of Service Pack `23.1`.

Hot Fixes are provided on the understanding that as soon as a Service Pack with the fix is available, the system will be upgraded.

The reason that a HF is the exception, rather than the rule, is that Quality Assurance is restricted to the specific fix, and as such, they are far riskier than Service Packs.

title: Product Support Policies
---
A glossary of terms and the Support policy for Alfresco Products, Components, and Versions.

## Product Support Policy

See the [Alfresco Product Support Status](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/technical-support/product-support-status){:target="_blank"} page for the current support state and transition dates for all Alfresco products.

Use the **Glossary** below for definitions, and the [Alfresco Product Support Lifecycle]({% link support/latest/policies/product-lifecycle.md %}) page for an overview on Support states and transitions.

At the time of release for any given Alfresco product or module, Alfresco will attempt to identify dates for support state transitions. Alfresco will identify support state transitions for each family of a given product and each release within each family. Support for given service pack or hotfix bundles will coincide with support transition dates for the family and release to which the service pack or hotfix apply.

In cases where Alfresco cannot identify support state transition dates in advance, the [Alfresco Product Support Status](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/technical-support/product-support-status){:target="_blank"} will reflect ‘TBA’ for that particular transition. Alfresco will announce TBA dates as soon as those dates can be determined. Wherever possible, Alfresco will announce transition dates at least 1 year in advance of the announced date. In some cases, for example, and without limitation, where 3rd party interactions are present, it may not be possible to adhere to the 1 year notification policy.

Alfresco may at its sole discretion restate transition dates for specific products to be later than the currently specified dates. In some cases, for example, and without limitation, where 3rd party interactions are present, Alfresco may at Alfresco’s sole discretion restate transition dates earlier than previously specified dates.

## Glossary

The following is a Glossary of terms related to the Alfresco Product Support policy:

|Term|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Version Numbering|Alfresco uses a 3-place numbering scheme to designate released versions of software. The format is **F.SP.HF**, where:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li><b>F</b> indicates the Family.</li><li><b>SP</b> indicates the Service Pack.</li><li><b>HF</b> indicates the Hot Fix.</li></ul>{:/} An example is version `23.1`. Often in referring to general product versions, only the first two numbers are used. For example, `23.1.1` may be referred to as `23.1`.<br><br>**Note:** Alfresco Modules, Add-ons, and Components may use a 3- or 4-place versioning scheme.  |
|Family|A family is a fully functional Alfresco product that typically contains significant new functionality. A family is referenced using the **F** portion of the release number as described previously.|
|Service Pack (SP)|A service pack is a cumulative patch release.|
|Hot Fix (HF)|A hot fix is a limited patch release.|

The Alfresco Product Support Lifecycle and the how Alfresco products, versions and components transitions through support states

## Product Support Status

The **Support Status** of Alfresco Products can change over time according to the **Alfresco Product Support Lifecycle**. This can happen for a number of reasons, including customer demand, product strategy changes and innovation.

To help customers plan around the **End of Maintenance** of our products, Alfresco publishes a list of all products with their current support status, first release date, deprecation date, and end of maintenance. This list is available on the [Alfresco Product Support Status](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/technical-support/product-support-status){:target="_blank"} page.

For general policies on Support of different Alfresco Product versions please refer to the [Alfresco Product Support Policy]({% link support/latest/policies/index.md %}) page.

## Product Support Lifecycle

 The Product Support Lifecycle defines how Alfresco Products, components and versions transition between different support states. An overview of product support states and state transitions is provided in the following image:

![Support Lifecycle]({% link support/images/product-support-lifecycle.png %})

The table below describes in detail the different transitions and support states of Alfresco products, versions and components:

|State / Transition|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|First Release (*Transition*)|The date on which a product is first made Generally Available.|
|Full Support (*State*)|Full support, services and code fixes are provided to customers with a current support contract, based on the terms & conditions per customer entitlement.|
|Deprecation (*Transition*)|The date on which the product is no longer sold or further developed.|
|Limited Support (*State*)|As a product version enters the limited support state, the following guidelines apply:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Alfresco Support will direct customers to existing fixes/patches and workarounds wherever possible. </li><li>Alfresco may direct customers to upgrade to a more current version/release of the product.</li><li>Alfresco will consider critical security issues in this support state.</li><li>Alfresco will not implement further enhancements or improvements for products or versions in this support state.</li></ul>{:/nomarkdown} For full details, please refer to the [Enhancement Policy]({% link support/latest/policies/enhancement.md %}).|
|End of Maintenance (*Transition*)|On the date a product version enters End of Maintenance, the following applies:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>The product version has matured to the Extended Support Program, with limited support offered by Alfresco Support. For full details, refer to the <a href="https://community.hyland.com/customer-portal/wiki/hyland-support/software-maintenance-extended-support-program" target="_blank">Extended Support Program</a>.</li><li>Code changes are no longer being made to this product.</li><li>Alfresco Support will direct customers to upgrade to a supported version of the product to address unexpected software behavior that cannot be resolved by the Support Analyst Team.</li></ul>{:/nomarkdown}|
|Open Source (*Optional Transition*)|As often as possible, products are converted into Community-led open source projects, with maintenance responsibilities handed over to the Alfresco Community.|
|Knowledge Base (KB) Support (*State*)|The product is no longer maintained. It will still be possible to search the Knowledge Base for articles regarding product versions that are no longer maintained. Upgrade support requests will still be accepted for these versions; Alfresco Support will apply the limited support guidelines in the upgrade situation.|
---
title: Security Policy
---

Describes how Alfresco will respond and fix security issues, depending on the issue severity. This policy applies to the Alfresco Enterprise built products, such as, Alfresco Content Services, Alfresco Process Services, and the Alfresco built Add-ons modules.

## Security incident response

When a security issue is discovered, Alfresco will:

* Direct the security incident to the appropriate Alfresco product subject matter expert and Alfresco Security Architect for evaluation of the incident's scope and severity.
* Make one or more product fixes available, if appropriate.
* Inform customers and partners

The version(s) where a particular security issue is resolved will depend on the severity of the issue, and may include:

* A Service Pack release for the last major version
* A Hot Fix to the last major versions
* Hot Fixes for older maintained versions

## Severity Levels

Alfresco classifies security issues according to a severity level of High, Medium, Low. If warranted, a security issue may be re-classified and the customer and/or partner will be notified as appropriate.

### Severity Level: High

A security issue is High if the vulnerability was discovered externally, is known about externally or is being actively exploited and one or more of the following is true:

* Customer data can be compromised
* The server running the application can be compromised
* A Denial of Service (DoS) can be caused, rendering the system unavailable .

### Severity Level: Medium

A security issue is Medium if either of the following are true:

* The issue would otherwise be High severity but the issue was discovered internally and/or is not believed to be known externally
* The issue is a less serious vulnerability such as a XSS or CSRF.

### Severity Level: Low

'Low' refers to trivial vulnerabilities which only pose a marginal or insignificant risk.

## Fix Versions

The severity of the issue and the Product Support Status determines which versions will be fixed.

For the support status of your version, refer to the [Alfresco Product Support Status](https://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/technical-support/product-support-status){:target="_blank"} page.

For definitions and glossary, refer to the [Product Support Lifecycle]({% link support/latest/policies/product-lifecycle.md %}) page.

Follows the fix version policy Alfresco Software will apply for security issues:

* **High** severity issues will be addressed for all versions of Alfresco in "Full Support" or "Limited Support" status.
* **Medium** severity issues will be addressed for Alfresco versions in "Full Support" status.
* **Low** severity issues will be addressed in the next service pack on each Alfresco version in "Full Support" status.

## Release of Security Notifications

Alfresco notifies customers and partners in the following manner:

* For **High** severity issues, Alfresco releases the version containing the fix and then sends a security alert email to all customers and partners. And then, publishes a security alert on Hyland Community with details of the issue and of the fixed versions. Full details of the vulnerability and attack vector will be publicly released but only after customers and partners have been given reasonable time to install the fixed version.
* For **Medium** severity issues, Alfresco releases the version containing the fix and publishes a security alert on Hyland Community with details of the issue and of the fixed versions.
* For **Low** severity issues, the fix is documented as part of the release notes for the service pack which includes the fix.

## Reporting a security issue to Hyland

Please report all security issues by logging a support case via [Hyland Community](https://community.hyland.com/){:target="_blank"}. See the [Contact Hyland Support]({% link support/latest/contact.md %}) page for more details. Support will assist in connecting you with the right resource to ensure that the information does not enter the public domain prematurely.

title: Service Pack Escalation Policy
---

In general, customer and partner issues are given priority over any community issues. These issues are addressed within the next Service Pack release possible based on complexity and prioritization.

Customers and partners may request that an issue be escalated into the next Service Pack. The Customer Care Advocate team handles all requests to ensure the Alfresco Product Management and Alfresco Engineering are aware of the escalation.

Alfresco includes a heartbeat message within Alfresco Content Services.

The heartbeat gathers the following information and sends the encrypted data back to the Alfresco heartbeat receiver over [https://hbrx.alfresco.com](https://hbrx.alfresco.com){:target="_blank"}:

* Version and schema version
* Unique repository id
* Internal server IP (if the same repository-id appears for several server IPs, it is a cluster)
* Number of people (total, not active)
* Maximum node-id (relates to number of objects in repository)
* IP & host address of the sender from the http header
* License

Collecting this data enables us to see how customers use Alfresco Content Services and to tune our product road map accordingly. In order to turn off the Heartbeat message within Alfresco Content Services, please refer to the product documentation, Knowledge Base or submit a support case.

title: Upgrade Advice
---

Alfresco customers and partners who have an active contract are eligible for all Version, and Service Pack upgrades. Periodic communications are used to notify all customers and partners, along with updates to Hyland Community product pages.

Technical Support is often asked for advice on what is likely to change between Alfresco Content Services (ECM) versions and also what preparation must be completed before upgrading your Alfresco Content Services (ECM) solution. Based on the type of upgrade you are doing, here are the recommendations that we make before applying changes in production.

|Upgrade Type|Code Changes|*Backup|*Testing Cycle|*Reindex|*Database Changes|
|------------|------------|------|---------|-------|------------|
|Version Upgrade|Major changes, enhancements, and fixes|Full|Full|Possible|Probable|
|Service Pack|Enhancements and fixes|Full|Custom code or extensions only|Unusual|Unusual|
|Hot Fix|Single fixes|Full|Full (Alfresco QA test single fix only)|Unusual|Unusual|

> **Note:** For Alfresco Content Services:<!--FIXME-->
>
> * If you are upgrading more than two releases (`7.0` to `23.1` for example), please contact Hyland.
> * The advice on service pack upgrades only applies if you are upgrading from the base release (`7.4` to `7.4.1` for example).
> * If you are upgrading from a previous release as well (`7.1` to `23.1` for example), follow the advice for the version upgrade.

This assumes you have:

* Reviewed the release notes and supported platform documentation.
* Ensured that your full backup works.
* Tested the upgrade on a test system against a restored backup of your production system.
* Checked the extensions included with the release and re-applied your changes if the sample file was modified.
* Allowed sufficient time to complete the upgrade.
